Energy Monitoring and Analytic Service (EMAS) and Building Automation System (BAS) are two essential tools for businesses and organizations that want to optimize their energy usage and minimize costs.

EMAS is a service that allows businesses to monitor and analyze their energy usage in real-time, providing them with valuable insights into where they can cut back and save money. By collecting data from various sources, EMAS can identify patterns and trends in energy consumption, helping businesses make informed decisions about their energy usage.

BAS, on the other hand, is an infrastructure communication network that enables businesses to control and automate various building systems, such as lighting and temperature, to save energy and reduce maintenance costs. By using sensors and other smart devices, BAS can adjust building systems to match occupancy levels, weather conditions, and other factors, ensuring that energy is not wasted unnecessarily.

Together, EMAS and BAS can revolutionize the way businesses manage their energy usage. With EMAS providing real-time data and insights, and BAS automating building systems, businesses can optimize their energy usage, reduce costs, and minimize their environmental impact.

If you’re looking for ways to save money and reduce your energy usage, EMAS and BAS are excellent tools to consider. By providing valuable insights and automating building systems, they can help you achieve your energy goals quickly and efficiently.
